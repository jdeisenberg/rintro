<h2 class="center">Pronunciation of &ldquo;Ы&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
This letter, ы, has absolutely
no counterpart in English.
</p>
<p>
Every book I have read has a different way to pronounce this letter.
One book says you should pronounce it as &ldquo;uh-ee&rdquo; said together quickly; another
as the <b>y</b> in Larr<b>y</b>.
</p>
<p>
Here's a method that comes very close to the actual sound in Russian:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Put your lips in position to say &ldquo;ee.&rdquo; Your lips will be stretched horizontally
and you&rsquo;ll be smiling (that&rsquo;s why photographers tell you to say &ldquo;cheese.&rdquo;).</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your lips in the &ldquo;ee&rdquo;  position.</p></li>
<li><p>With the rest of your mouth, say &ldquo;oo&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Out comes this weird sound <img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker" onclick="playSound('rsnd/eui')"/>,
	which is exactly the one you want.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Step three is the hardest part. When you say &ldquo;oo&rdquo; your lips just want to spring
back to a round O shape out of habit. You may actually have to hold your lips
in place with your thumb and index finger the first few times you try this.
</p>
<p>
If all of this is too hard for you, just pronounce it like the short &ldquo;<b>i</b>&rdquo; in
the word &ldquo;<b>i</b>n&rdquo;, or pronounce it as a very softly spoken
&ldquo;<b>oi</b>&rdquo;; it's not accurate, but you will be understood.

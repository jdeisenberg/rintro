<h2>The Last Two</h2>
<p>
Can you believe it? You've learned all the letters of the Russian alphabet except
two:
</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="big">Ь
Ъ</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
Neither of these letters carries any sound; instead, they modify the sound of
the previous letter. They are called &ldquo;soft sign&rdquo; and &ldquo;hard sign.&rdquo;
<p>
You will see the first one (known as the &ldquo;soft sign&rdquo;) much more often. In fact,
whenever you look up a verb in the dictionary, it will end with &ldquo;ть&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
As a beginner, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about either of these letters.
You may simply treat them as silent letters, and you will get along fine.
</p>
<p>
If you are compulsively curious, though, <a href="tech.html">here are the
details</a>.

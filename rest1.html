<h2>Where's the Restaurant?</h2>
That's right -- you need to eat, so you need to know how to ask where
the restaurant is.  Here's what it sounds like: 
<button onclick="playSound('rsnd/whrrst')"><img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker"/></button>
and to spell it, we'll need two letters, each of which has a Picture Drama.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Picture Drama #1</h3>
<p><span>Here is a picture of an oa<b>r</b>, which you use to
  <b>r</b>ow, <b>r</b>ow, <b>r</b>ow your <b>r</b>aft down the
  <b>r</b>iver.</span>
  <img src="pics/oar2.png" alt="oar" width="16" height="78" class="vmid" /></p>
  
  <p>
  And here is a <b>R</b>ussian letter that looks like that oa<b>r</b>:
  <span class="big">Р</span>.
  You pronounce it with a &ldquo;trill,&rdquo; and it sounds like this (very
  lengthened and exaggerated so you can hear it):
  <button onclick="playSound('rsnd/rrr')"><img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker"/></button>
  </p>
  <p>
  If you can't do the trill, just make it sound like the first
  consonant in <b>r</b>est, and everyone will still understand you.
  </p>

<h3>Picture Drama #2</h3>
<p>Here is a picture of a <b>s</b>emicircle.
    <img src="pics/semi1.png" alt="semicircle" width="41" height="24" class="vmid"/></td>
 </p>
 
 <p>
  Even if we flip it on its <b>s</b>ide, it's <b>s</b>till the <b>s</b>ame
  <b>s</b>illy <b>s</b>emicircle.
  <img src="pics/semi2.png" alt="semicircle" width="24" height="41" class="vmid" /></td>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  And here is the Russian letter that looks like the <b>s</b>emicircle,
  has the name &ldquo;ess,&rdquo; and the consonant <b>s</b>ound of the word <b>s</b>ame:
    <span class="big">С</span>
  

<hr />
<p>
Now we know all the letters we need to write the word for "restaurant,"
<button onclick="playSound('rsnd/restrnt')"><img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker"/></button>.

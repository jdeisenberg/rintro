<h2>Hard and Soft Sign</h2>
<p>
Here are the technical details:
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;soft sign,&rdquo; <span class="big">Ь</span>, indicates
that you should <em>palatalize</em> the preceding consonant. That is, you touch
your tongue to the hard palate (the roof your mouth near your teeth). This adds
a sort of &ldquo;y&rdquo; sound to the consonant.
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;hard sign,&rdquo; <span class="big">Ъ</span>, used to be used
primarily to indicate that you should <em>not</em> palatalize the consonant.
Nowadays, it has the main purpose of forcing a syllable break.
</p>
<p>
You can hear the difference between a soft consonant and a hard consonant,
as in the American English &ldquo;do&rdquo; <img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker" onclick="playSound('rsnd/do')"/>
and the British English &ldquo;dew.&rdquo; <img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker" onclick="playSound('rsnd/dew')"/>

</blockquote>
<p>
There are a few words where the presence or absence of a soft sign changes the
meaning of a word. For example, 
</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- r(u'gol) --><span class="big">у&#x301;гол</span>
 means "corner," but <!-- r(u'gol-) --><span class="big">у&#x301;голь</span>
 means "coal."
 </blockquote>
 <p>
Again, don't worry
about this - the context will make your usage clear. Given a choice between sentences
that translate to:
</p>
<blockquote>
The bank is around the corner.<br>
The bank is around the coal.
</blockquote>
<p>
a native Russian will figure out the correct meaning even if you pronounce
it incorrectly.

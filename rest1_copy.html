<h2>Where's the Restaurant?</h2>
That's right -- you need to eat, so you need to know how to ask where
the restaurant is.  Here's what it sounds like: 
<img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker" onclick="playSound('rsnd/whrrst')"/>
and to spell it, we'll need two letters, each of which has a Picture Drama.
</p>
<p>

	<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	At the right is a picture of an oa<b>r</b>, which you use to
	<b>r</b>ow, <b>r</b>ow, <b>r</b>ow your <b>r</b>aft down the
	<b>r</b>iver.
	</td>
	<td><img src="pics/oar2.png" alt="oar" width="16" height="78" /></td>
	</tr>
	<td>
	<p>
	And here is a <b>R</b>ussian letter that looks like that oa<b>r</b>.
	You pronounce it with a "trill", and it sounds like this (very
	lengthened and exaggerated so you can hear it):
	<img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker" onclick="playSound('rsnd/rrr')"/>
	</p>
	<p>
	If you can't do the trill, just make it sound like the first
	consonant in <b>r</b>est, and everyone will still understand you.
	</p>
	</td>
	<td><img src="pics/bigr.png" width="27" height="44" /></td>
	</tr>
	</table>


	<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	At the right is a picture of a <b>s</b>emicircle.
	</td>
	<td><img src="pics/semi1.png" alt="semicircle" width="41" height="24" /></td>
	</tr>
	<td>
	Even if we flip it on its <b>s</b>ide, it's <b>s</b>till the <b>s</b>ame
	<b>s</b>tupid <b>s</b>emicircle.
	</td>
	<td><img src="pics/semi2.png" alt="semicircle" width="24" height="41" /></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>
	At the right is a Russian letter that looks like the <b>s</b>emicircle,
	has the name "ess", and the consonant <b>s</b>ound of the word <b>s</b>ame.
	</td>
	<td><img src="pics/bigs.png" width="27" height="44" /></td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Now we know all the letters we need to write the word for "restaurant,"
<img src="pics/speaker.png" alt="Play" class="speaker" onclick="playSound('rsnd/restrnt')"/>.

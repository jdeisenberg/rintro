<h1>The Big Secret: It&rsquo;s a Different Game</h1>
<p>
Russian is a different language with a different alphabet and different rules,
just as pinochle and poker are different card games with different sets of cards and
different rules.
</p>
<p>
When you move from pinochle to poker, you find some new cards (2 through 8).
You find some familiar looking cards (9 through Ace). Some of the familiar cards
work the same in
both games&mdash;Ace is high&mdash;while other familiar cards are used differently -
in pinochle a 10 outranks
a Queen; in poker the Queen outranks a 10. If you try to use pinochle rules when
playing poker, you are <strong>not</strong> going to win!
</p>
<p>
When put in terms of card games, this is obvious,
but you&rsquo;d be surprised how many people try to apply their
knowledge of the English alphabet when they&rsquo;re learning Russian. Don&rsquo;t fall into
that trap!

<p>
 Some Russian letters will be completely new. Some Russian letters will look
like English ones, and they may even sound alike, but <strong>be
not deceived</strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s a pure coincidence.
If you try to use the English rules on Russian letters,
you can&rsquo;t win, because...
</p>
<h2 style="color: red">It&rsquo;s a Different Game</h2>
<p>
For example, the rules of English say that the word &ldquo;<b>yes</b>&rdquo;
signifies agreement. If you&rsquo;ve watched any spy movies, though, you know that
Russians use a different rule: 
<img src="pics/speaker.png" width="26" height="24" align="absmiddle"
  onclick="playSound('rsnd/yes')"/>
signifies agreement.
(Click the speaker to hear the word.)
</p>
<p>
Now click the right arrow to see how that word is written.

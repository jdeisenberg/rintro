<h2 style="color: #66cc66">Why Learn The Alphabet?</h2>
<p>
Probably the easiest thing you can do to make a visit to Russia more
pleasant is to learn the alphabet. You&rsquo;ll feel much more comfortable if you can
read street signs and advertisements; you won&rsquo;t have that absoutely helpless feeling
that comes with being illiterate.
</p>
<p>
If you&rsquo;re learning Russian just for fun, the alphabet is a quick and easy way to
get into the subject.
</p>
<h2 style="color: #cc9900">You Keep Saying “Easy”</h2>
<p>
Yes. It is easy. Russian is a very phonetic language, which means that, in general,
things are pronounced exactly as written. Once you&rsquo;ve learned the alphabet, you&rsquo;ll be
ahead of the game. Click the right arrow below to find out the big secret to the

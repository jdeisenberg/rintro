There is also a little mistake on a "drink1" page. The word квас (kvas)
only has one "с" in Russian.
BTW, at the same page you say that "лимонад" (limonad) means a soft
drink. It used to in the Soviet times but now you will hardly hear it (at
least in Moscow or other major cities). It's become nearly obsolete. In
restaurants they use "прохладительные напитки" (refreshment drinks)═or
"безалкогольные напитки" (alcohol-free drinks)═to refer to soft drinks.
In casual speech I can't think of any special word for soft drinks.

<title>Which Browser to Use</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Which Browser?</h1>
The preferred browser for viewing these pages is
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> Navigator, version 3.0 or
above.
<p>
The original version of these pages made heavy use of JavaScript. Unfortunately,
Microsoft<sup>TM</sup>&reg;&copy Internet Explorer<sup>TM</sup>&reg;&copy;'s version
of JavaScript could not handle important constructs such as include files.
<p>
I spent a very unpleasant forty-five minutes modifying all my files to avoid using
this feature, but the pages now work with Internet Explorer<sup>TM</sup>&reg;&copy; version
3, which many people still have.
<p>
What this means to you is that one or two of the pages will take a bit
longer to load than in the original version.
<p>
What it means to me, as the author, is that any change I would have been able to make
in one file now must be made in several files, with the added possibility of errors.
It also means that my structure for navigating between pages is no longer as
general and easy to modify.
<p>
So congratulations to Netscape for providing a powerful tool like Javascript. Shame on
Microsoft<sup>TM</sup>&reg;&copy; for not supporting Javascript's best features in
their browser.

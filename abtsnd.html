This tutorial uses sound files to help you learn the language.
I've had a lot of email about people who haven't been able
to hear the sound correctly in these tutorials.  As of
14 July 2000, I've changed the way that sound files get
loaded in the newer browsers.  I hope this will fix the
problem.
</p>
<p>
For your information, all the files are in .WAV format;
your browser should be able to play them. If you still
can't hear them, please
<a href="mailto:david@catcode.com?subject=Still no sound">send me email</a> and
tell me which browser you're using and which version, as well
as which page didn't give you sound.  If you
get an error message on the screen, please write it down exactly
and send that to me as well. This will assist me greatly in 
tracking down the problem.
</p>
<p>
Also: if you are using the QuickTime plugin, and don't seem to hear
the last part of the sounds, go to Start->Control Panels->Quicktime, then
select "Sound Out" from the combo box, and select the correct
sound output device.
